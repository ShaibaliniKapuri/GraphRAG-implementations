      "Text classification is a common NLP task that assigns a label or class to text. Some of the largest companies run text classification in production for a wide range of practical applications. One of the most popular forms of text classification is sentiment analysis, which assigns a label like üôÇ positive, üôÅ negative, or üòê neutral to a sequence of text.\n",
      "This guide will show you how to:\n",
      "To see all architectures and checkpoints compatible with this task, we recommend checking the task-page.\n",
      "Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:\n",
      "We encourage you to login to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community. When prompted, enter your token to login:\n",
      "Start by loading the IMDb dataset from the ü§ó Datasets library:\n",
      "Then take a look at an example:\n",
      "There are two fields in this dataset:\n",
      "The next step is to load a DistilBERT tokenizer to preprocess the text field:\n",
      "Create a preprocessing function to tokenize text and truncate sequences to be no longer than DistilBERT‚Äôs maximum input length:\n",
      "To apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset, use ü§ó Datasets map function. You can speed up map by setting batched=True to process multiple elements of the dataset at once:\n",
      "Now create a batch of examples using DataCollatorWithPadding. It‚Äôs more efficient to dynamically pad the sentences to the longest length in a batch during collation, instead of padding the whole dataset to the maximum length.\n",
      "Including a metric during training is often helpful for evaluating your model‚Äôs performance. You can quickly load a evaluation method with the ü§ó Evaluate library. For this task, load the accuracy metric (see the ü§ó Evaluate quick tour to learn more about how to load and compute a metric):\n",
      "Then create a function that passes your predictions and labels to compute to calculate the accuracy:\n",
      "Your compute_metrics function is ready to go now, and you‚Äôll return to it when you setup your training.\n",
      "Before you start training your model, create a map of the expected ids to their labels with id2label and label2id:\n",
      "If you aren‚Äôt familiar with finetuning a model with the Trainer, take a look at the basic tutorial here!\n",
      "You‚Äôre ready to start training your model now! Load DistilBERT with AutoModelForSequenceClassification along with the number of expected labels, and the label mappings:\n",
      "At this point, only three steps remain:\n",
      "Trainer applies dynamic padding by default when you pass tokenizer to it. In this case, you don‚Äôt need to specify a data collator explicitly.\n",
      "Once training is completed, share your model to the Hub with the push_to_hub() method so everyone can use your model:\n",
      "If you aren‚Äôt familiar with finetuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial here!\n",
      "Then you can load DistilBERT with TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification along with the number of expected labels, and the label mappings:\n",
      "Convert your datasets to the tf.data.Dataset format with prepare_tf_dataset():\n",
      "Configure the model for training with compile. Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don‚Äôt need to specify one unless you want to:\n",
      "The last two things to setup before you start training is to compute the accuracy from the predictions, and provide a way to push your model to the Hub. Both are done by using Keras callbacks.\n",
      "Pass your compute_metrics function to KerasMetricCallback:\n",
      "Specify where to push your model and tokenizer in the PushToHubCallback:\n",
      "Then bundle your callbacks together:\n",
      "Finally, you‚Äôre ready to start training your model! Call fit with your training and validation datasets, the number of epochs, and your callbacks to finetune the model:\n",
      "Once training is completed, your model is automatically uploaded to the Hub so everyone can use it!\n",
      "For a more in-depth example of how to finetune a model for text classification, take a look at the corresponding\n",
      "PyTorch notebook\n",
      "or TensorFlow notebook.\n",
      "Great, now that you‚Äôve finetuned a model, you can use it for inference!\n",
      "Grab some text you‚Äôd like to run inference on:\n",
      "The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a pipeline(). Instantiate a pipeline for sentiment analysis with your model, and pass your text to it:\n",
      "You can also manually replicate the results of the pipeline if you‚Äôd like:\n",
      "Tokenize the text and return PyTorch tensors:\n",
